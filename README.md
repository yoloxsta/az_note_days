01. Which Azure service is designed to extend on-premises networks into the cloud securely?
      - VPN Gateway

02. Azure App Services is primarily used for:
      - Hosting Web App

03. ExpressRoute allows you to:
      - create private connections between Azure data centers and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation environment without going over the public internet, offering more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies

### Storage

01. Azure Migrate primarily assists organizations in:
      - Migrating on-premises servers,app,data and workloads to azure

02. Azure Storage Explorer is a tool that can be used to:
      - View and interact with az storage data

03. Azure Blob Storage is best used for:
      - storing unstructured data (text,binary data)

04. Azure Data Box is used to transfer large amounts of data to Azure in situations where uploading over the internet might be too slow or not feasible.

05. An Azure Storage Account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data, accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. It acts as a container for storing your data objects such as blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks.

## IAS

01. Azure AD B2B (Business-to-Business) collaboration is designed to allow businesses to securely share their applications and resources with guest users from any other organization, leveraging their own identities.
    Azure AD B2C (Business-to-Consumer), on the other hand, provides identity and access management solutions specifically designed for customer-facing applications, supporting a variety of identity providers.

02. Defense in depth is a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that layers multiple security measures to protect resources, including physical security, identity and access management, perimeter security, network security, and data security practices.

03. The Zero Trust security model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originates from an open network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust principle "never trust, always verify" is applied.

## Exam Prepare

- In Azure Virtual Networks, subnets allow administrators to segment the virtual network into one or more sub-networks, providing organized and enhanced control of network traffic.

- Azure Container Instances offers the simplest and easiest way to deploy containers in Azure. Other container solutions are considered if you need orchestration capabilities.

- Azure Regions and Region Pairs optimize application performance and user experience by hosting applications closer to users, reducing network latency.

- Azure Bicep is an Infrastructure-as-Code solution that can be used to deploy identical resources programmatically.

- Point-to-Site VPN connections can be used to establish connectivity from remote workstations or clients to Azure virtual network

- The hybrid cloud model combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This model is ideal for businesses that need both customization and control offered by private clouds, along with the scalability of public cloud services.

- Azure Management Groups provide a level of scope above subscriptions, allowing users to efficiently manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions.

- Microsoft Purview offers a unified data governance service that helps organizations manage, govern, and protect their data across enterprise systems and applications.

- Azure Tags allow users to organize resources by assigning metadata to resources in the form of tags, which can be used to categorize resources for clarity and billing purposes.

- Azure ExpressRoute lets you create private connections between Azure data centers and infrastructure on your premises or in a colocation environment. These connections do not go over the public internet and offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies, and higher security than typical connections.

- Azure Government is dedicated for US government entities and contractors.

- Azure Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. Each zone is made up of one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. They are set up to provide redundancy and high availability within the region.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides customers with a platform allowing them to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity associated with maintaining the infrastructure typically required to develop and launch an app.

- Azure Data Box services are designed to transfer large amounts of data to Azure securely and efficiently, especially useful when network transfer is not viable.

- You can download compliance related documents from Service Trust Portal.

- A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection is used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. This type of connection requires a VPN device located on-premises that has an externally facing public IP address assigned to it.

- Azure Service Health provides a personalized view of the health of the Azure services and regions you're using. This is the best place to look for service impacting communications about outages, planned maintenance activities, and other health advisories because the authenticated Service Health experience knows which services and resources you currently use.

- The Android tablet device will have a web browser (say Chrome). That’s enough to connect to the Azure portal. The Azure portal offers three ways to create a VM:

-Using the graphical portal

-Using the Azure Cloud Shell using Bash 

-Using the Azure Cloud Shell using PowerShell

- The central feature in Defender for Cloud that enables you to achieve those goals is secure score.

- We can configure alerts based on the Activity Log. Service Health Alerts cannot notify any user-initiated events.

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud – whether they're in Azure or not – as well as on premises.

- Azure Advisor helps you optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources. You can get cost recommendations from the Cost tab on the Advisor dashboard.

- A PowerShell script is a file that contains PowerShell cmdlets and code. A PowerShell script needs to be run in PowerShell. In Options C and D, there is no mention of PowerShell installation. Without PowerShell installed, you can’t run PowerShell scripts.
